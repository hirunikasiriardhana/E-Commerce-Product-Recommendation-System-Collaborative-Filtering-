# E-Commerce-Product-Recommendation-System-Collaborative-Filtering-
This project involves building an e-commerce product recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. By analyzing data columns such as Product ID, Product Rating, Product review count, and Product Tags, the system identifies patterns and similarities between user preferences and product attributes. Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the system generates personalized product recommendations. The goal is to enhance the shopping experience by suggesting products that align with user interests and behaviors and providing tailored recommendations based on collaborative filtering.
